# Pest Control API Testing Guide

This guide will help you populate the database with sample data and test all the APIs using Postman.

## Prerequisites

- Django backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- Python environment with all dependencies installed
- Postman installed for API testing

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Superuser

First, create an admin user to authenticate with the APIs:

```bash
python manage.py create_superuser
```

This will create a user with:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`
- Email: `admin@pestcontrol.com`

You can customize these values using the `--username`, `--password`, and `--email` flags.

### 2. Populate Database with Sample Data

Run the following command to populate the database with realistic test data:

```bash
python manage.py populate_sample_data
```

This will create:
- **20 clients** with realistic Indian names, addresses, and contact details
- **30 inquiries** with various statuses and service interests
- **50 job cards** with different statuses, payment statuses, and realistic pricing
- **25 renewals** linked to completed job cards

#### Customizing Sample Data

You can customize the amount of data generated:

```bash
# Create more data
python manage.py populate_sample_data --clients 50 --inquiries 100 --jobcards 200 --renewals 100

# Create less data
python manage.py populate_sample_data --clients 10 --inquiries 15 --jobcards 25 --renewals 10

# Clear existing data before populating
python manage.py populate_sample_data --clear
```

### 3. Import Postman Collection

1. Open Postman
2. Click "Import" button
3. Import the `postman_collection.json` file
4. The collection will be imported with all API endpoints organized by resource type

## Testing Workflow

### 1. Authentication
1. Use the "Get JWT Token" request with admin credentials
2. Copy the `access_token` from the response
3. Set the `access_token` variable in Postman collection variables
4. All subsequent requests will automatically use this token

### 2. Test CRUD Operations
1. **Create** resources using POST requests
2. **Read** resources using GET requests
3. **Update** resources using PUT requests
4. **Delete** resources using DELETE requests

### 3. Test Filtering and Search
1. Use query parameters to filter results
2. Test search functionality with different search terms
3. Test date range filtering
4. Test status-based filtering

### 4. Test Special Endpoints
1. **Webhook endpoint** - Test without authentication
2. **Convert inquiry** - Test the conversion workflow
3. **Statistics endpoints** - Test analytics and reporting

## Sample Data Details

### Clients
- **Names**: Realistic Indian names (Raj Sharma, Priya Verma, etc.)
- **Cities**: Major Indian cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, etc.)
- **Mobile**: 10-digit numbers starting with 9

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure you're using a valid JWT token
   - Check if the token has expired
   - Use the refresh token endpoint if needed

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Some operations require admin privileges
   - Check if your user has the necessary permissions

3. **Validation Errors**
   - Ensure all required fields are provided
   - Check data format (dates, mobile numbers, etc.)
   - Mobile numbers must be unique

4. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure the database is properly migrated
   - Check if sample data was created successfully

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check Django server status
python manage.py runserver

# Check database migrations
python manage.py showmigrations

# Access Django admin
# Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/ and login with superuser credentials

# Clear all data and start fresh
python manage.py populate_sample_data --clear
```
